[Chat](https://chat.jonazwetsloot.nl/) is a social media platform created by Jona Zwetsloot as a hobby project giving a fun experience—especially for Dutch users, though it's open to everyone.

However, Chat has very limited support for bots, and its public API is capped at 1,000 requests/day. The documentation is also outdated and incomplete, missing important endpoints.

SelfbotV2 is a Python library that wraps the Chat API in a clean, easy-to-use interface — with up-to-date documentation and proper type support.

This library **does not break [Chat’s Terms of Service](https://chat.jonazwetsloot.nl/terms-of-service)** in any way.

If you’re a developer who wants to build cool stuff with Chat but found the official API too limiting (and you prefer python over js)—this library is for you!
